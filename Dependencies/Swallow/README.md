A complement to the Swift standard library. This framework contains a suite of essential protocols and types that are missing from the standard library, and attempts to maintain API parity with the latest Swift evolution trends. 

Swallow is composed of the following modules:
- `Swallow`
- `Diagnostics`
- `FoundationX`
- `Compute`
- `POSIX`
- `Runtime`

Along with the miscellaneous modules:
