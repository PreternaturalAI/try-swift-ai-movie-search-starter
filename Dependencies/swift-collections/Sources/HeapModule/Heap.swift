/// A container type implementing a double-ended priority queue.
/// `Heap` is a container of `Comparable` elements that provides immediate
/// access to its minimal and maximal members, and supports removing these items
/// or inserting arbitrary new items in (amortized) logarithmic complexity.
///
///     var queue: Heap<Int> = [3, 4, 1, 2]
///     queue.insert(0)
///     print(queue.min)      // 0
///     print(queue.popMax()) // 4
///     print(queue.max)      // 3
///
/// `Heap` implements the min-max heap data structure, based on
/// [Atkinson et al. 1986].

/// To efficiently implement these operations, a min-max heap arranges its items
/// into a complete binary tree, maintaining a specific invariant across levels,
/// called the "min-max heap property": each node at an even level in the tree
/// must be less than or equal to all its descendants, while each node at an odd
/// level in the tree must be greater than or equal to all of its descendants.
/// To achieve a compact representation, this tree is stored in breadth-first
/// order inside a single contiguous array value.
///
/// Unlike most container types, `Heap` doesn't provide a direct way to iterate
/// over the elements it contains -- it isn't a `Sequence` (nor a `Collection`).
/// This is because the order of items in a heap is unspecified and unstable:
/// it may vary between heaps that contain the same set of items, and it may
/// sometimes change in between versions of this library. In particular, the
/// items are (almost) never expected to be in sorted order.
///
/// For cases where you do need to access the contents of a heap directly and
/// you don't care about their (lack of) order, you can do so by invoking the
/// `unordered` view. This read-only view gives you direct access to the
/// underlying array value:
///
///     for item in queue.unordered {
///       ...
///     }
///
/// The name `unordered` highlights the lack of ordering guarantees on the
/// contents, and it helps avoid relying on any particular order.
