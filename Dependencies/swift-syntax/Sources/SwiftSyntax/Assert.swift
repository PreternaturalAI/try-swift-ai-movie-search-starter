/// How to choose `assert` vs. `precondition`:
///  - Wherever possible, it is preferable to emit a diagnostic instead of
///    using `precondition`. This way the parser won't crash if the condition is
///    violated.
///  - If you think the diagnostic added above should never be emitted, it is
///    fine to also emit an `assertionFailure` in debug builds to make it easier
///    to debug the unexpected diagnostic.
///  - If in doubt always use `precondition`
///  - `assert` should only be used if checking the assertion has a non-trivial
///    cost and provides little benefit in terms of safety in release builds.

// MARK: - Assert

/// An assertion that is active in DEBUG builds, just like `Swift.assert` and
/// additionally if assertions are explicitly requested by setting the
/// `SWIFTSYNTAX_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS` conditional compilation flag.
/// Use this instead of `precondition` in places where the assertion has a
/// non-trivial cost but provides little value in release builds.

/// Override Swiftâ€™s `precondition` with slightly changed semantics.
/// In release builds, it also emits the error message upon failure, like `fatalError`.
