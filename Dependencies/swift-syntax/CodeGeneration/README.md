# Code-Generation for SwiftSyntax

This directory contains file to generate source code that is part of the SwiftSyntax package. If you are looking to generate Swift code yourself, you might be interested in [SwiftSyntaxBuilder](../Sources/SwiftSyntaxBuilder).

Some source code inside SwiftSyntax is generated using [SwiftSyntaxBuilder](../Sources/SwiftSyntaxBuilder), a Swift library whose purpose is to generate Swift code using Swift itself. This kind of code generation is performed by the Swift package defined in this directory.

This directory is a standalone package that uses swift-syntax from the outer directory. 
If you are making significant changes to `CodeGeneration` locally and want to avoid breaking the build of `CodeGeneration` itself by generating new files in the parent swift-syntax package, it is encouraged to change the dependency from
```swift
.package(path: "..")
```
to 
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax", branch: "main")
```
That way `CodeGeneration` has its own checkout of swift-syntax that is unaffected by the newly generated files. Be sure to revert the change before committing your changes.

To re-generate the files after changing `CodeGeneration` run the `generate-swift-syntax` 
target of `CodeGeneration` and pass `path/to/swift-syntax/Sources` as the argument.

On the command line, this would be
```bash
swift run --package-path CodeGeneration generate-swift-syntax Sources
```

Or if you open the `CodeGeneration` package in Xcode, you can add the 
`generate-swift syntax ../Sources` arguments using Product -> Scheme -> Edit Schemeâ€¦
