# Interactive Workshop: Build an AI-Powered Movie Search App
*Instructor: @NatashaTheRobot*
<p>The best way to learn AI is to actually build with it! This is an interactive workshop challenge where you will be building an AI-Powered Movie Search App. We will meet on Friday for a pre-building session where the conceptual ideas required for the app will be discussed. You will then be provided with a detailed step-by-step guide on how to build the app, including all the resources needed. You will then spend the week(end) building the app - any questions or obstacles you encounter can be posted in the workshop Slack channel, where you will be given support by the course instructors and fellow peers. This workshop is in collaboration with Vatsal Manot.</p>

Skills you will learn:

* How to work with the OpenAI API
* How to Get Training Data to Experiment With
* How to work with Text Embeddings
* Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* How to Implement Advanced Generalized Search (e.g. 'romantic movies in New York City')
